I live in an old house with electric heating. I set up Domoticz so that I could fine tune when the heaters start and stop.

I made some LUA scripts but they were not really nice and tried to make Python work with Domoticz but couldn't.

I serendipitycally found that you could do everything with Domoticz with its JSON API. You simply need to have access to Domoticz API.

So here are the scripts that I use at home. Feel free to fork them to your needs.
